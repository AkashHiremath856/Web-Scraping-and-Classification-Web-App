# Web Scraping and Classification Web App Documentation

## Introduction
This documentation outlines the features and functionality of a web application built with Streamlit, designed to scrape news data from specified URLs or dropdown selections. The scraped data is then classified using a MultinomialNB model with a 90%+ accuracy, trained on a custom dataset created for this purpose.

## Requirements
To run the web app, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- NLTK
- MySQL

Or run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` which is available in the project directory.

# Usage
## Native

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=INFO` in the terminal and another run `streamlit run app.py`
3. Access the web app in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

## Using Docker
1. Open terminal in Project directory.
2. Run `docker build -t my-python-app .`
3. Then run `docker run -d -p 8501:8501 my-python-app`
4. Access the web app in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

## Web App Features
### Input Options:
- Enter a URL directly or select from a dropdown list of pre-defined URLs.

### Data Scraping:
- Utilizes the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape news data from the specified URLs.

### Data Classification [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akashhiremath25/eventclassifier-twitter-data-set/data):
- Employs a MultinomialNB model with over 93% accuracy for classifying news descriptions.
- Classification categories include:
  - "political"
  - "positive"
  - "protest"
  - "riot"
  - "terror"
  - "disaster"
  - "other"

### Pre-processing:
- NLTK is used for natural language processing and text pre-processing to enhance the accuracy of the classification model.

### Save to MySQL Database:
- Integrates with MySQL for storing the scraped and classified data.

## Data Classification Model
- The Multinomial model used for classification is trained on a custom dataset.
- The dataset includes labelled examples for each of the specified categories.
- The training process involves tokenization, vectorization, and model training using NLTK.

## MySQL Database
- The web app is configured to connect to a MySQL database for storing the scraped and classified data. Ensure that you have a MySQL server running and provide the necessary credentials in the app.

## Celery Integration
- Celery is integrated into the application for asynchronous task execution. This ensures smooth and efficient processing of scraping and classification tasks, especially for large datasets.

## Conclusion
This web app serves as a powerful tool for scraping news data, classifying it with high accuracy, and storing the results in a MySQL database. By combining the capabilities of Streamlit, Requests, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, and MySQL, it provides a comprehensive solution for extracting valuable insights from online news content.

Feel free to customize and extend the functionality based on your specific requirements and datasets.

**Note:** Project is built on Windows and tested on Windows and Ubuntu. If Celery fails to run on Window, Prefer using `Linux` with RabbitMQ server installed.
